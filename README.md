# ðŸŽ“ Student Management System â€“ SQL Project

This project demonstrates how to design and query a **Student Management Database** using **MySQL**. It simulates a simple academic environment where students are enrolled in courses and receive marks, and various SQL queries are used to extract useful insights.

##  Project Objectives

- Design a normalized database with tables for students, courses, and marks.
- Insert and manage sample student data.
- Write SQL queries to:
  - View student records
  - Join tables for meaningful relationships
  - Calculate average marks
  - Filter students based on performance

##  Database Schema

- **`student`**: stores student details (ID, name, age, gender)
- **`courses`**: contains course IDs and names
- **`mark`**: records marks per student per course with foreign keys
